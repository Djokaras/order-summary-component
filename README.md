## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Positioning elements using flexbox. Setting up breakpoints for media queries.

```css trick learned to seperate one element in the flex with margin
.plan-section {
	background: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
	padding: 2rem 3rem;
	border-radius: 16px;

	display: flex;
	gap: 2.4rem;
	align-items: center;
}

.plan-change {
	margin-left: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

Need to work on the responsive design more. And should try mobile-first approach.
